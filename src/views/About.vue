      Backcountry Buddy is here to help connect fellow backcountry skiers and
      snowboarders, and help them plan tours together. Nobody should be alone
      out there!
    </p>

    <p class="mb-2">The problem it's trying to solve is not new:</p>

    <p class="mb-2">
      Weather is great, you have time to hit the backcountry but none of your
      friends have time when you're trying to get out. The risk of going alone
      is too high. If something unforeseen happens, you're stuck, or worse. You
      shouldn't do it, no matter how experienced you are, and how well you know
      the terrain you're trying to head into.

        >thread on Reddit</a
      >, a few user stories describing a set of basic features were hashed out
      and a simple first version of the site was made public later in October.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-2">
      Since then, functionality has slowly been added, always listening to user
      feedback and what's needed by the backcountry community.

      This is a 100% volunteer project, without profits or fees. The code lives

      If you can code and/or design, poke around the project on Github and open
      a PR. The basic tech of this project is Vue.js and Firebase. If you want
      to learn more, send us an email at ask(at)backcountrybuddy.org and we are
      happy to fill you in with more details. It's not rocket science.

      <span class="font-semibold">And above all: spread the word.</span> This
      project only works if it reaches a critical mass of users. If you can
      promote send a link to this project to your local group ro friends. The
      more backountry skiers and snowboarders are using it to plan tours, the
      better!
