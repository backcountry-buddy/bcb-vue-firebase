      Backcountry Buddy is here to help connect fellow backcountry skiers and
      snowboarders, and help them plan tours together.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-2">The problem it's trying to solve is not a new one:</p>

    <p class="mb-2">
      Weather is great, you have time to hit the backcountry bot none of your
      friends are either into backcountry or don't have time when you're trying
      to get out. The risk of going alone is too high, if something happens,
      you're stuck or worse. You shouldn't do it, no matter how experienced you
      are and how well you might know the terrain you're trying to head into.

      Then, in Sommer 2019, after this

        >thread on Reddit</a
      >, a few user stories were hashe out and a simple first version of the
      site was made public in October.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-2">
      Since then, functionality has slowly been added, alway listening to user
      feedback and what's needed by the backcountry community.

    <p class="mb-2">
      This is a 100% volunteer project, without profits or fees. The code lives
      in a

      <span class="font-semibold">And above all: spread the word.</span> This
      project only works if it reaches a critical mass of users. The more
      backountry skiers and snowboarders are using it to plan tours, the better!
